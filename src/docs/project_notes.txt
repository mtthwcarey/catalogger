Options 1 (speech input) 2 (one line text input) are least developed right now. I recommend just using the batch file option (#3) for the time being.

The system uses natural language processing, so you should be able to just write out some basic info about your book in any order. I've been having success making entries with no punctuation or capitalization. Each entry goes on a separate line.

Example:

communication between man and dolphin john lilly crown publishers 1978 hardback with d/j
the leyden papers edited by griffith and thompson dover 0-486-22994-7 1974 trade paperback
the children of fatima mary fabyan windeatt saint benedict press trade paperback 2012
a new science of life rupert sheldrake park street press trade paperback 1995
william gibson the miracle worker paperback bantam 1962

Obviously more info will get you better results. 

You will need an OpenAI API key to run Catalogger. 
Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY.
